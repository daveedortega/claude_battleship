# Incredible Claude AI vibecoded battleship game

The hard fact of the matter truth is, I have ceased to be an AI esceptic and am now in the herd pack of those preaching the changing of times that AI brings. 

I literally just used [claude](https://claude.ai/) to vibecode this IN A WHIM. Literally no more than 3 prompts. I am, beyond excited for what it may bring. 

I know it is such a tiny thing, but you HAVE to understand, I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT javascript, tailwind, react, or anything. A long time ago I used html

and css and what not and I believe I am more techsavy than most, but nowhere near good enough to code this in 2 minutes. 

Incredible. 

PLAY!
